# Week 1 - Personal Information Manager

This is my first Python project for *The Developers Arena* internship (Week 1).

It is a simple Python program that stores and displays personal information.

## What I Learned

- Variables: how to store different types of data
- Input/Output: getting user input and printing results
- String Formatting: using f-strings for clean output
- Basic Error Handling: simple validation for empty input

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd week1-personal-info
